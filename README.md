# PoS-Simulator
This Python-based simulation only focuses on the essential components of a PoS-based consensus protocol, such as the selection of a block proposer and the incentive mechanism. We then added to it the strategic behavior of nodes and the networkâ€™s ability to audit to detect and punish this behavior.
